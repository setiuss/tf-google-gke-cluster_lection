# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cluster Terraform module

This module deploys a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) service. The GKE cluster is provisioned with a single node pool, and it comes with a generated Kubernetes configuration file (`kubeconfig`) that is stored locally.
